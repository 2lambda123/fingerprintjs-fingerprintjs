# FingerprintJS

Work in progress, stay tuned.

## Quick start

### In browser

```html
<script>
  function onFingerprintJSLoad(fp) {
    fp.get().then(({ visitorId }) => console.log(visitorId));
  }
</script>
<script
  async src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs@3.0.0-beta.2/dist/fp.min.js"
  onload="FingerprintJS.load().then(onFingerprintJSLoad)"
></script>
```

A simple way to start but not recommended because AdBlock and similar browser extensions often block this URL.
You should at least upload the script to your server.

### Webpack/Rollup/Browserify

```bash
npm i @fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs
```

```js
import * as FPJS from '@fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs';

(async () => {
  const fpjs = await FPJS.load();
  const { visitorId } = await fpjs.get();
  console.log(visitorId);
})();
```

## Version policy

The library doesn't promise same visitor identifier between any versions
but tries to keep them same as much as reasonable.

The documented JS API follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).
Using undocumented features is at you own risk.

## Contribution

### Development playground

```bash
# Make sure you have Yarn installed
yarn install
yarn playground:start # Add '--port 8765' to change the server port
```

Then open http://localhost:8080 in a browser.
It's reloaded every time the source code is changed.

To build the playground distribution code (e.g. to upload to a static server), run:

```bash
yarn playground:build
```

The result will appear at `playground/dist`.

### How to build

To build the distribution files of the library, run:

```bash
yarn build
```

The files will appear at `dist`.

### How to test

There are automatic tests.
They are run by [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io) in real browsers using [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

To run the tests in a browser on your machine, build the project and run:
```bash
yarn test:local --browsers ChromeHeadless
# or to run in Firefox
yarn test:local --browsers FirefoxHeadless
# or to run in both
yarn test:local
```

To run the tests in browsers on [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com), get a BrowserStack access key and run:
```bash
# For Linux, macOS and WSL (Linux on Windows)
BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME=your-username BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY=your-key yarn test:browserstack
```
Or make a PR to this repository, the test will run in BrowserStack automatically.
BrowserStack sessions are unstable, so a session can fail for no reason;
restart the testing when you see no clear errors related to the tests.

Unit test files are located right next to individual module files that they check.
Integration tests are located in the `tests` directory.

### How to publish

1. Bump the version. Changing the number in [package.json](package.json) is enough.
2. Build and test the project.
3. See what's will get into the NPM package, make sure it contains the distributive files and no excess files.
    To see, run `yarn pack`, an archive will appear nearby, open it with any archive browser.
4. Run
    ```bash
    yarn publish --access public # Add '--tag beta' (without the quotes) if you release a beta version
    ```
